# Email Verification and Password Reset Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing email verification
and password reset functionality for the Spirit of Kiro game. The system will
enhance security by ensuring users have valid email addresses and provide a
secure mechanism for password recovery.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Email Verification During Registration

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to verify my email address during
registration, so that I can ensure my account is secure and I can receive
important notifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes the registration form THEN the system SHALL send a
   verification email to the provided email address
2. WHEN a user submits registration THEN the system SHALL create an unverified
   account that cannot access game features
3. WHEN a user receives the verification email THEN it SHALL contain a unique
   verification link that expires after 24 hours
4. WHEN a user clicks the verification link THEN the system SHALL verify the
   email address and activate the account
5. WHEN a user attempts to sign in with an unverified email THEN the system
   SHALL display a message prompting email verification
6. WHEN a user requests a new verification email THEN the system SHALL send a
   new verification link and invalidate previous ones
7. IF the verification link is expired THEN the system SHALL display an error
   message and offer to resend verification

### Requirement 2: Password Reset Request

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to reset my password when I forget
it, so that I can regain access to my account without losing my game progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Forgot Password" on the sign-in page THEN the system
   SHALL display a password reset request form
2. WHEN a user enters their email address for password reset THEN the system
   SHALL send a password reset email if the email exists in the system
3. WHEN a user enters a non-existent email address THEN the system SHALL display
   a generic success message for security purposes
4. WHEN a password reset email is sent THEN it SHALL contain a unique reset link
   that expires after 1 hour
5. WHEN a user clicks the reset link THEN the system SHALL display a secure
   password reset form
6. WHEN a user submits a new password THEN it SHALL meet the same complexity
   requirements as registration
7. IF the reset link is expired THEN the system SHALL display an error message
   and redirect to request a new reset

### Requirement 3: Secure Password Reset Process

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want the password reset process
to be secure, so that my account cannot be compromised by malicious actors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a password reset link is generated THEN it SHALL be cryptographically
   secure and unpredictable
2. WHEN a password reset link is used THEN it SHALL be immediately invalidated
   to prevent reuse
3. WHEN a password is successfully reset THEN all existing user sessions SHALL
   be terminated
4. WHEN a password reset is completed THEN the user SHALL receive a confirmation
   email
5. WHEN multiple password reset requests are made THEN only the most recent link
   SHALL be valid
6. WHEN a password reset link is accessed THEN the system SHALL log the attempt
   for security monitoring
7. IF suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL temporarily lock the
   account and notify the user

### Requirement 4: Email Verification Resend

**User Story:** As a user who didn't receive the verification email, I want to
request a new verification email, so that I can complete my account setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to sign in with an unverified account THEN the system
   SHALL display a "Resend Verification" option
2. WHEN a user clicks "Resend Verification" THEN the system SHALL send a new
   verification email
3. WHEN a new verification email is sent THEN previous verification links SHALL
   be invalidated
4. WHEN a user requests verification resend multiple times THEN the system SHALL
   implement rate limiting (max 3 per hour)
5. IF rate limiting is exceeded THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate
   error message
6. WHEN verification is resent THEN the system SHALL update the expiration time
   to 24 hours from the new send time

### Requirement 5: Email Template Management

**User Story:** As a user receiving system emails, I want them to be
professional and informative, so that I trust the communication and understand
what actions to take.

#### Acceptance Criteria

   legally required
5. WHEN emails contain links THEN they SHALL be clearly labeled and explain

7. IF email delivery fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure and provide
   alternative contact methods

### Requirement 6: Account Security Notifications

events, so that I can detect and respond to unauthorized access attempts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

   email (even if email doesn't exist in system)

### Requirement 7: Integration with Existing Authentication

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the email verification and password reset
to integrate seamlessly with the existing Amazon Cognito authentication system,
so that the implementation is secure and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing email verification THEN it SHALL use Amazon Cognito's
   built-in email verification features
